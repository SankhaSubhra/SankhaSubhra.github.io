classification, theoretical performance analysis of learning algorithms, investigating the applicability of
classification performance indices under the effect of data anomalies, evolutionary optimization techniques such as
differential evolution, and density based clustering with a focus on application in Computer Vision and Bioinformatics.

<h3> Current and Past Research Problems </h3>
<h5>Class Imbalanced Classification</h5>
Improve immunity of Support Vector Machines, <i>k</i>-Nearest Neighbor, and Deep Neural Network classifiers against the detrimental effects of class imbalance.

<h5>Theoretical Analysis of Classifiers</h5>
Mathematically investigate how class imbalance affects the performance of a classifier as well as the popular
evaluation indices.

<h5>Differential Evolution (DE)</h5>
Design variants of DE for large scale and noisy real valued global optimization problems. Apply DE to address problems like parameter optimization in classifiers, adversarial attacks on Deep Neural Network classifiers, etc.

<h5>Classification in Presence of Label-based Ambiguity</h5>
Formally define as an umbrella problem for various class label-based ambiguities such as noisy labels, crowd-sourced
labels, unreliable experts, etc. Design classifiers which can effectively resolve such ambiguities.
